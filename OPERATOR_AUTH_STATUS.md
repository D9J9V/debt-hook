# Operator Authorization Status

## Current Situation

The DebtHook contract at `0x0C075a62FD69EA6Db1F65566911C4f1D221e40c8` has been successfully updated with operator authorization logic in the code, but this update needs to be deployed.

## What We've Done

1. ✅ Added `authorizedOperators` mapping to DebtHook
2. ✅ Added `authorizeOperator()` function (restricted to treasury)
3. ✅ Updated `createBatchLoans()` to require operator authorization
4. ✅ Added `OperatorAuthorized` event
5. ✅ Contract compiles successfully

## The Challenge

The DebtHook address was mined to have specific permission bits (6, 7, 3) encoded in the address itself. This is a requirement for Uniswap V4 hooks. We cannot simply redeploy to the same address because:

1. CREATE2 prevents deploying to an address that already has code
2. The address itself encodes the hook permissions
3. Changing the bytecode changes the CREATE2 address

## Options Moving Forward

### Option 1: Deploy New DebtHook (Recommended)
1. Mine a new address with the same permission bits
2. Deploy the updated DebtHook with operator authorization
3. Update all references (OrderBook, frontend, etc.)
4. Authorize the operator address

### Option 2: Add Upgrade Proxy
1. Deploy a proxy pattern (complex for hooks)
2. Requires significant contract restructuring
3. May interfere with hook mechanics

### Option 3: Test Without Authorization
1. Comment out the authorization check temporarily
2. Test the full flow
3. Deploy with authorization for production

## Next Steps

To deploy a new DebtHook with operator authorization:

```bash
# 1. Run the deployment script
cd blockchain
forge script script/DeployHook.s.sol \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.unichain.org \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast

# 2. Update the operator with new addresses
# Edit unicow/operator/.env with new DEBT_HOOK_ADDRESS

# 3. Authorize the operator
# The deployment script should handle this, or run separately
```

## Testing the Current Setup

Even though the current DebtHook doesn't have authorization, we can test that:
1. ✅ ServiceManager is deployed and receiving orders
2. ✅ Operator is running and monitoring
3. ✅ DebtOrderBook can verify operator signatures
4. ❌ DebtHook.createBatchLoans() requires authorization (not yet deployed)

## Summary

The code is ready, but requires a new deployment to take effect. The mined address requirement for V4 hooks means we need to carefully coordinate the update of all dependent systems.
