# Deployment Update

## Current Status

After attempting to deploy the updated DebtHook with operator authorization, we discovered:

1. **Contract Size Issue**: The DebtHook contract exceeds the size limit (24815 > 24576 bytes)
2. **No Contracts on Chain**: The addresses listed in README.md don't have any deployed code on Unichain Sepolia
3. **Authorization Code Added**: The DebtHook.sol has been updated with:
   - `mapping(address => bool) public authorizedOperators`
   - `authorizeOperator(address, bool)` function
   - Authorization check in `createBatchLoans()`

## Options to Proceed

### Option 1: Optimize Contract Size
- Remove unused functions or comments
- Split contract into multiple contracts
- Use libraries for common functionality

### Option 2: Deploy Minimal Version
- Create a simplified DebtHook with only essential functions
- Move batch loan creation to a separate contract

### Option 3: Use Proxy Pattern
- Deploy logic contract separately
- Use minimal proxy for the hook address

## Recommended Next Steps

1. First, verify the deployment status:
   ```bash
   # Check if contracts exist on Unichain Sepolia
   cast code <address> --rpc-url https://sepolia.unichain.org
   ```

2. If contracts don't exist, we need to:
   - Optimize the DebtHook contract to fit size limits
   - Deploy all contracts fresh
   - Update README with actual deployed addresses

3. The operator authorization feature is ready in the code but requires deployment to take effect.
