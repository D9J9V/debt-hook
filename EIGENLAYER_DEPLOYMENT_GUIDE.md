### Integration Status
- âœ… ServiceManager deployed to Ethereum Sepolia
- âœ… DebtOrderBook connected to ServiceManager
- âœ… Operator environment configured
- ðŸ”„ Ready for operator registration and testing

## Next Steps

### 1. Register and Start Operator
```bash
cd unicow/operator
npm run register-operator
npm run start
```

### 2. Authorize Operator in DebtHook
After starting the operator, get its address from the console and authorize it:
```solidity
// TODO: Add this function to DebtHook
debtHook.authorizeOperator(operatorAddress);
```

### 3. Test the Integration
Submit test orders through the frontend or scripts to see the matching in action.

## Architecture Recap

The system works without cross-chain complexity:
1. Users sign orders off-chain (EIP-712)
2. EigenLayer AVS on Ethereum provides operator security
3. All DeFi execution happens on Unichain
4. Operators simply submit matched batches as regular transactions

## Operator Monitoring

When the operator is running, you'll see:
- New order detection
- Batch formation every 10 blocks
- Matching results with optimal rates
- Transaction submissions to Unichain
