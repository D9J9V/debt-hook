# Next Steps for DebtHook Deployment

## Summary of Current State

1. **EigenLayer AVS**: ‚úÖ Successfully deployed on Ethereum Sepolia
   - ServiceManager: `0x3333Bc77EdF180D81ff911d439F02Db9e34e8603`
   - Operator: Running and monitoring for orders

2. **DebtHook**: üîÑ Needs redeployment with operator authorization
   - Code updated with `authorizedOperators` mapping
   - `createBatchLoans()` now requires authorization
   - Contract size exceeds limit, use `DebtHookOptimized.sol`

3. **Unichain Contracts**: ‚ùå Not found at listed addresses
   - Need fresh deployment of all contracts

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy Optimized Contracts

```bash
cd blockchain
forge script script/DeployHookOptimized.s.sol \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.unichain.org \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast
```

### 2. Update Configurations

After deployment, update these files with new addresses:
- `unicow/operator/.env`
- `dapp/.env.local`
- `README.md`

### 3. Restart Services

```bash
# Restart operator with new addresses
cd unicow/operator
npm run start

# Update frontend
cd dapp
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Test the Flow

1. Submit a test order to ServiceManager
2. Verify operator picks it up
3. Check batch loan creation on DebtHook
4. Confirm authorization is working

## Key Changes Made

- ‚úÖ Added operator authorization to DebtHook
- ‚úÖ Created optimized contract version
- ‚úÖ Deployment scripts ready
- ‚úÖ EigenLayer AVS operational
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated

## Files Modified

- `blockchain/src/DebtHook.sol` - Added authorization
- `blockchain/src/DebtHookOptimized.sol` - Size-optimized version
- `blockchain/script/DeployHookOptimized.s.sol` - Deployment script
- `README.md` - Updated deployment status

The system is ready for deployment once you run the optimized deployment script!
