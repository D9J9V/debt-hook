# Final Deployment Status

## What We Accomplished

1. **✅ EigenLayer AVS Deployed** (Ethereum Sepolia)
   - ServiceManager: `0x3333Bc77EdF180D81ff911d439F02Db9e34e8603`
   - StakeRegistry: `0x3Df55660F015689174cd42F2FF7D2e36564404b5`
   - Operator running and monitoring for orders

2. **✅ DebtHook Updated with Authorization**
   - Added `authorizedOperators` mapping
   - Added `authorizeOperator()` function
   - Updated `createBatchLoans()` to check authorization
   - Code is ready but needs deployment

3. **❌ Deployment Blocked by Size Limit**
   - Original DebtHook: 24,189 bytes (just under 24,576 limit)
   - With authorization: ~24,815 bytes (exceeds limit)
   - Optimized version: 16,193 bytes (works!)

## Current Issue

The contract addresses in README.md appear to not exist on Unichain Sepolia:
- No code at `0x0C075a62FD69EA6Db1F65566911C4f1D221e40c8` (DebtHook)
- No code at `0xDB8cFf278adCCF9E9b5da745B44E754fC4EE3C76` (DebtOrderBook)
- No code at `0x5b73C5498c1E3b4dbA84de0F1833c4a029d90519` (PoolManager)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy Optimized Version (Recommended)
We created `DebtHookOptimized.sol` that:
- Includes operator authorization ✅
- Fits within size limits ✅
- Has all core functionality ✅
- Ready to deploy with `DeployHookOptimized.s.sol`

### Option 2: Verify Existing Deployment
- Check if contracts are on a different network
- Verify the RPC endpoint is correct
- Confirm the addresses in README

### Option 3: Split Contract
- Move batch operations to separate contract
- Keep hook minimal for size constraints

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the optimized contracts**:
   ```bash
   forge script script/DeployHookOptimized.s.sol \
     --rpc-url https://sepolia.unichain.org \
     --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
     --broadcast
   ```

2. **Update all references**:
   - README.md with new addresses
   - unicow/operator/.env
   - dapp/.env.local

3. **Test the complete flow**:
   - Submit orders to ServiceManager
   - Operator matches and submits to DebtHook
   - Verify batch loan creation

## Architecture Summary

```
User → Signs Order (EIP-712) → ServiceManager (Ethereum Sepolia)
                                       ↓
                              Operator Matches Orders
                                       ↓
                            Submits to DebtHook (Unichain)
                                       ↓
                              Batch Loans Created
```

The multi-chain architecture works without bridges because orders are signed off-chain and operators simply relay the matched results.
