# DebtHook Protocol

A revolutionary DeFi lending protocol that combines Uniswap V4 hooks for efficient liquidations with EigenLayer AVS for decentralized order matching creating the most capital-efficient lending market.

## Overview

DebtHook is a lending protocol that leverages three key innovations:

1. **Uniswap V4 Hooks**: Atomic liquidations within swap transactions
2. **EigenLayer AVS**: Decentralized debt order matching with Coincidence of Wants (CoW)
3. **Circle Paymaster Integration**: Users pay transaction fees with USDC instead of ETH 

## Core Mechanics

### How It Works

1. **Order Creation**:
   - Lenders and borrowers submit orders to the EigenLayer AVS
   - Orders specify principal amounts, interest rate ranges, and maturity dates
   - No on-chain transaction required - orders are signed off-chain

2. **Order Matching**:
   - EigenLayer operators run the CoW matching algorithm
   - Finds optimal interest rates that benefit both parties
   - Batches multiple orders for gas efficiency
   - Example: Lender wants 5% minimum, Borrower accepts 6% maximum ‚Üí Match at 5.5%

3. **Loan Execution**:
   - Matched orders execute in batches on-chain
   - USDC transfers from lenders to borrowers
   - Borrowers deposit ETH collateral following barrier option model from theory.md
   - All loans tracked in the DebtHook contract

4. **Liquidations**:
   - Implements barrier option model: liquidation triggers when C_t = D_t (collateral equals debt)
   - This creates a "Down-and-Out Call" for borrowers and "Protected Put" for lenders
   - Executes atomically within ETH/USDC swaps via V4 hooks
   - No separate liquidation bots or transactions needed
   - 5% liquidation penalty to treasury, remaining collateral returns to borrower

### Key Innovations

#### 1. EigenLayer Verified CoW for Interest Rates
Unlike traditional lending protocols where rates are set by utilization curves, DebtHook uses Coincidence of Wants matching:

```
Traditional: Fixed rates based on pool utilization
DebtHook: Dynamic rates based on order matching

Example:
- Alice: Wants to lend 10,000 USDC at 5%+ APR
- Bob: Wants to borrow 10,000 USDC at 6%- APR
- Result: Matched at 5.5% APR (optimal for both)
```
#### 2. All-or-Nothing Fair Liquidation
Unlike traditional lending protocols where liquidation depends on keepers, we leverage hooks to run all-or-nothing liquidations that disperse payouts fairly:

```
Traditional: MEV-prone keeper liquidations with race conditions
DebtHook: Atomic liquidations within swap transactions

Example:
- Loan becomes liquidatable (C_t = D_t)
- Next ETH/USDC swap automatically triggers liquidation
- Lender receives full debt repayment
- Treasury gets 5% penalty
- Borrower gets remaining collateral
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **DebtHook.sol**: Core lending logic with V4 hook integration
   - Manages loans and collateral
   - Implements beforeSwap/afterSwap for automatic liquidations
   - Handles batch loan creation from matched orders
   - Uses transient storage (TSTORE/TLOAD) for gas-efficient liquidation data
   - Hook permissions: beforeSwap (bit 7), afterSwap (bit 6), beforeSwapReturnDelta

2. **DebtOrderBook.sol**: Order management with EIP-712 signatures
   - Validates signed orders
   - Integrates with EigenLayer ServiceManager
   - Maintains backward compatibility for direct orders
   - Implements EIP-712 domain separator for secure signatures

3. **DebtOrderServiceManager.sol**: EigenLayer AVS for matching
   - Receives orders from DebtOrderBook
   - Coordinates operator responses
   - Validates operator minimum stake weight
   - Triggers batch execution in DebtHook

### Technical Implementation Details

#### V4 Hook Mechanics
- **Hook Address Mining**: Must deploy to address with permission bits 6 & 7 set
- **beforeSwap**: Scans for liquidatable positions (health factor < 1.5)
- **afterSwap**: Executes liquidation and distributes proceeds
- **Transient Storage**: Uses assembly TSTORE/TLOAD for passing data between callbacks
- **Gas Optimization**: Liquidations piggyback on existing swaps (no separate transactions)

#### Liquidation Model
Implements a **Barrier Option Model** based on financial theory:
- Liquidation triggers when collateral value equals debt value (C_t = D_t)
- Surplus collateral after debt repayment returns to borrower
- 5% liquidation penalty goes to treasury
- Creates a "Down-and-Out Call" for borrowers and "Protected Put" for lenders

#### Interest Calculation
Uses **continuous compounding** with PRB Math library for precision:
```
A_t = P * e^(r*t)
where:
- P = principal amount
- r = annual interest rate
- t = time in years
- e = Euler's number
```
This ensures fair interest accrual regardless of repayment timing.

### Off-Chain Components

1. **Operator Node** (TypeScript):
   - Monitors new loan orders
   - Runs CoW matching algorithm
   - Submits matched batches to ServiceManager
   - Optimizes for best interest rates

2. **Frontend** (Next.js):
   - Order creation interface
   - Portfolio management dashboard
   - Real-time order book visualization
   - Smart wallet integration for gas abstraction

## üé® Frontend Features

- **Market View**: Real-time order book with depth chart
- **Portfolio Dashboard**: Active positions for lenders and borrowers
- **Order Builder**: Intuitive interface for creating orders
- **Gas Abstraction**: Pay gas in USDC via Circle Paymaster
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality on all devices

## üí≥ USDC Gas Payment Integration

DebtHook integrates Circle's USDC Paymaster for seamless gas payments:

### How It Works
1. **Permit Signing**: Users sign an EIP-2612 permit allowing the paymaster to spend USDC
2. **Gas Estimation**: Frontend calculates USDC cost based on current gas prices
3. **Atomic Payment**: Gas fees deducted from USDC balance during transaction
4. **No ETH Required**: Perfect for users who only hold stablecoins

### Implementation Details
- **CirclePaymaster.sol**: EIP-4337 compliant paymaster contract
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Configurable exchange rate (initially 1 USDC = 3000 gwei)
- **Safety Buffer**: 10% markup on gas estimates to handle price fluctuations
- **Frontend Toggle**: Users can choose between ETH or USDC for gas

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Enable USDC gas payment in frontend
const { preparePaymaster } = usePaymaster()
const paymasterData = await preparePaymaster(estimatedGasLimit)

// Transaction automatically uses USDC for gas
await debtOrderBook.createLoanWithOrder(order, signature, {
  paymasterAndData: paymasterData
})
```

## üìä Protocol Advantages

1. **Better Rates**: CoW matching ensures optimal rates for all parties
2. **Gas Efficiency**: Batch execution reduces costs by 70%+
3. **No Liquidation Bots**: Integrated liquidations save gas and prevent MEV
4. **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the order book
5. **Flexible**: Partial order fills and multiple maturity options

## ü§ù Integration Guide

### For Developers
```typescript
// Submit a lender order
const order = {
  principalAmount: parseUnits("10000", 6), // USDC
  minRate: 500, // 5% APR
  maxRate: 1000, // 10% APR
  maturityTimestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60,
  expiry: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 24 * 60 * 60
};

await debtOrderBook.submitOrderToAVS(order, signature);
```

### For Protocols
DebtHook can be integrated as a lending layer for any protocol needing capital-efficient loans with guaranteed liquidations.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Optimize Current Architecture (Post-MVP Q3 2025)
1. **Enhanced Batch Liquidation System** (Planned)
   - Current implementation handles single liquidations per swap
   - Future: Accumulate multiple liquidations in single transaction
   - Gas savings: ~70% vs individual liquidations
   - Distribute proceeds fairly using delta accounting

2. **Advanced V4 Hook Features**
   - Fee reduction hook for protocol users
   - Loyalty points system for liquidity providers
### Phase 2: USDC Paymaster (Implemented ‚úÖ)
- **CirclePaymaster.sol**: Full EIP-4337 paymaster implementation

- **Frontend Integration**: Toggle for USDC gas payments in UI
- **Smart Account Support**: Works with both EOAs and smart wallets
- Users can pay gas in USDC with ~10% buffer for price fluctuations

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Q4 2025)
